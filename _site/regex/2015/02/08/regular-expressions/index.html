<p>Perl regular expressions from boost <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/perl_syntax.html">here</a></p>

<h1 id="perl-regular-expression-syntax">Perl Regular Expression Syntax</h1>

<p>In Perl regular expressions, all characters match themselves except for the following special characters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>.[{}()*+?|^$</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="wildcard">Wildcard</h2>

<p>The single character ‘.’ when used outside of a character set will match any single character except:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The NULL character when the flag match_not_dot_null is passed to the matching algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The newline character when the flag match_not_dot_newline is passed to the matching algorithms.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="anchors">Anchors</h2>

<p>A ‘^’ character shall match the start of a line.</p>

<p>A ‘$’ character shall match the end of a line.</p>

<h2 id="marked-sub-expressions">Marked sub-expressions</h2>

<p>A section beginning ( and ending ) acts as a marked sub-expression. Whatever matched the sub-expression is split out in a separate field by the matching algorithms. Marked sub-expressions can also repeated, or referred to by a back-reference.</p>

<h2 id="non-marking-grouping">Non-marking grouping</h2>

<p>A marked sub-expression is useful to lexically group part of a regular expression, but has the side-effect of spitting out an extra field in the result. As an alternative you can lexically group part of a regular expression, without generating a marked sub-expression by using (?: and ) , for example (?:ab)+ will repeat ab without splitting out any separate sub-expressions.</p>

<h2 id="repeats">Repeats</h2>

<p>Any atom (a single character, a marked sub-expression, or a character class) can be repeated with the *, +, ?, and {} operators.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The * operator will match the preceding atom zero or more times</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The + operator will match the preceding atom one or more times</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ? operator will match the preceding atom zero or one times</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An atom can also be repeated with a bounded repeat:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a{n} Matches ‘a’ repeated exactly n times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a{n,} Matches ‘a’ repeated n or more times.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a{n, m} Matches ‘a’ repeated between n and m times inclusive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the “{“ and “}” characters will treated as ordinary literals when used in a context that is not a repeat: this matches Perl 5.x behavior. For example in the expressions “ab{1”, “ab1}” and “a{b}c” the curly brackets are all treated as literals and no error will be raised.</p>

<h3 id="non-greedy-repeats"><em>Non greedy repeats</em></h3>

<p>The normal repeat operators are “greedy”, that is to say they will consume as much input as possible. There are non-greedy versions available that will consume as little input as possible while still producing a match.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>*? Matches the previous atom zero or more times, while consuming as little input as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>+? Matches the previous atom one or more times, while consuming as little input as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>?? Matches the previous atom zero or one times, while consuming as little input as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>{n,}? Matches the previous atom n or more times, while consuming as little input as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>{n,m}? Matches the previous atom between n and m times, while consuming as little input as possible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="possessive-repeats"><em>Possessive repeats</em></h3>

<p>By default when a repeated pattern does not match then the engine will backtrack until a match is found. However, this behaviour can sometime be undesireble so there are also “possessive” repeats: these match as much as possible and do not then allow backtracking if the rest of the expression fails to match.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>*+ Matches the previous atom zero or more times, while giving nothing back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>++ Matches the previous atom one or more times, while giving nothing back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>?+ Matches the previous atom zero or one times, while giving nothing back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>{n,}+ Matches the previous atom n or more times, while giving nothing back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>{n,m}+ Matches the previous atom between n and m times, while giving nothing back.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="back-references">Back references</h2>

<p>An escape character followed by a digit n, where n is in the range 1-9, matches the same string that was matched by sub-expression n. For example the expression:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>^(a<em>).</em>\1$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will match the string:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>aaabbaaa</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not the string:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>aaabba</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also use the \g escape for the same function, for example:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Escape</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\g1</td>
      <td>Match whatever matched sub-expression 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\g{1}</td>
      <td>Match whatever matched sub-expression 1: this form allows for safer parsing of the expression in cases like \g{1}2 or for indexes higher than 9 as in \g{1234}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\g-1</td>
      <td>Match whatever matched the last opened sub-expression</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\g{-2}</td>
      <td>Match whatever matched the last but one opened sub-expression</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\g{one}</td>
      <td>Match whatever matched the sub-expression named “one”</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Finally the \k escape can be used to refer to named subexpressions, for example \k&lt;two&gt; will match whatever matched the subexpression named “two”.</p>

<h2 id="alternation">Alternation</h2>

<p>The | operator will match either of its arguments, so for example: abc|def will match either “abc” or “def”.</p>

<p>Parenthesis can be used to group alternations, for example: ab(d|ef) will match either of “abd” or “abef”.</p>

<p>Empty alternatives are not allowed (these are almost always a mistake), but if you really want an empty alternative use (?:) as a placeholder, for example:</p>

<p>|abc is not a valid expression, but</p>

<p>(?:)|abc is and is equivalent, also the expression:</p>

<p>(?:abc)?? has exactly the same effect.</p>

<h2 id="character-sets">Character sets</h2>

<p>A character set is a bracket-expression starting with [ and ending with ], it defines a set of characters, and matches any single character that is a member of that set.</p>

<p>A bracket expression may contain any combination of the following:</p>

<h3 id="single-characters"><em>Single characters</em></h3>

<p>For example [abc], will match any of the characters ‘a’, ‘b’, or ‘c’.</p>

<h3 id="character-ranges"><em>Character ranges</em></h3>

<p>For example [a-c] will match any single character in the range ‘a’ to ‘c’. By default, for Perl regular expressions, a character x is within the range y to z, if the code point of the character lies within the codepoints of the endpoints of the range. Alternatively, if you set the collate flag when constructing the regular expression, then ranges are locale sensitive.</p>

<h3 id="negation"><em>Negation</em></h3>

<p>If the bracket-expression begins with the ^ character, then it matches the complement of the characters it contains, for example [^a-c] matches any character that is not in the range a-c.</p>

<h3 id="character-classes"><em>Character classes</em></h3>

<p>An expression of the form [[:name:]] matches the named character class “name”, for example [[:lower:]] matches any lower case character. See character class names.</p>

<h3 id="collating-elements"><em>Collating Elements</em></h3>

<p>An expression of the form [[.col.]] matches the collating element col. A collating element is any single character, or any sequence of characters that collates as a single unit. Collating elements may also be used as the end point of a range, for example: [[.ae.]-c] matches the character sequence “ae”, plus any single character in the range “ae”-c, assuming that “ae” is treated as a single collating element in the current locale.</p>

<p>As an extension, a collating element may also be specified via it’s symbolic name, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[[.NUL.]]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>matches a \0 character.</p>

<h3 id="equivalence-classes"><em>Equivalence classes</em></h3>

<p>An expression of the form [[=col=]], matches any character or collating element whose primary sort key is the same as that for collating element col, as with collating elements the name col may be a symbolic name. A primary sort key is one that ignores case, accentation, or locale-specific tailorings; so for example [[=a=]] matches any of the characters: a, À, Á, Â, Ã, Ä, Å, A, à, á, â, ã, ä and å. Unfortunately implementation of this is reliant on the platform’s collation and localisation support; this feature can not be relied upon to work portably across all platforms, or even all locales on one platform.</p>

<h3 id="escaped-characters"><em>Escaped Characters</em></h3>

<p>All the escape sequences that match a single character, or a single character class are permitted within a character class definition. For example [[]] would match either of [ or ] while [\W\d] would match any character that is either a “digit”, or is not a “word” character.</p>

<h3 id="combinations"><em>Combinations</em></h3>

<p>All of the above can be combined in one character set declaration, for example: [[:digit:]a-c[.NUL.]].</p>

<h2 id="escapes">Escapes</h2>

<p>Any special character preceded by an escape shall match itself.</p>

<p>The following escape sequences are all synonyms for single characters:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Escape</th>
      <th>Character</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\a</td>
      <td>\a</td>

      <td>\v</td>
      <td>\v</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\b</td>
      <td>\b (but only inside a character class declaration).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\cX</td>
      <td>An ASCII escape sequence - the character whose code point is X % 32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\xdd</td>
      <td>A hexadecimal escape sequence - matches the single character whose code point is 0xdd.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\x{dddd}</td>
      <td>A hexadecimal escape sequence - matches the single character whose code point is 0xdddd.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\0ddd</td>
      <td>An octal escape sequence - matches the single character whose code point is 0ddd.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>\N{name}</td>
      <td>Matches the single character which has the symbolic name name.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="single-character-character-classes"><em>“Single character” character classes</em></h3>

<p>Any escaped character x, if x is the name of a character class shall match any character that is a member of that class, and any escaped character X, if x is the name of a character class, shall match any character not in that class.</p>

<p>The following are supported by default:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Escape sequence</th>
      <th>Equivalent to</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>\d</td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="word-boundaries"><em>Word Boundaries</em></h3>

<p>The following escape sequences match the boundaries of words:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>&lt; Matches the start of a word.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>&gt; Matches the end of a word.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\b Matches a word boundary (the start or end of a word).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\B Matches only when not at a word boundary.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="continuation-escape"><em>Continuation Escape</em></h3>

<p>The sequence \G matches only at the end of the last match found, or at the start of the text being matched if no previous match was found. This escape useful if you’re iterating over the matches contained within a text, and you want each subsequence match to start where the last one ended.</p>

<h3 id="quoting-escape"><em>Quoting escape</em></h3>

<p>The escape sequence \Q begins a “quoted sequence”: all the subsequent characters are treated as literals, until either the end of the regular expression or \E is found. For example the expression: \Q*+\Ea+ would match either of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*+a</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>*+aaa</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="unicode-escapes"><em>Unicode escapes</em></h3>

<p>\C Matches a single code point: in Boost regex this has exactly the same effect as a “.” operator. \X Matches a combining character sequence: that is any non-combining character followed by a sequence of zero or more combining characters.</p>

<h3 id="matching-line-endings"><em>Matching Line Endings</em></h3>

<p>The escape sequence \R matches any line ending character sequence, specifically it is identical to the expression (?&gt;\x0D\x0A?|[\x0A-\x0C\x85\x{2028}\x{2029}]).</p>

<h3 id="keeping-back-some-text"><em>Keeping back some text</em></h3>

<p>\K Resets the start location of $0 to the current text position: in other words everything to the left of \K is “kept back” and does not form part of the regular expression match. $` is updated accordingly.</p>

<p>For example foo\Kbar matched against the text “foobar” would return the match “bar” for $0 and “foo” for $`. This can be used to simulate variable width lookbehind assertions.</p>

<h3 id="any-other-escape"><em>Any other escape</em></h3>

<p>Any other escape sequence matches the character that is escaped, for example \@ matches a literal ‘@’.</p>

<h2 id="perl-extended-patterns">Perl Extended Patterns</h2>

<p>Perl-specific extensions to the regular expression syntax all start with (?.</p>

<h3 id="named-subexpressions"><em>Named Subexpressions</em></h3>

<p>You can create a named subexpression using:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(?<name>expression)</name></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which can be then be referred to by the name NAME. Alternatively you can delimit the name using ‘NAME’ as in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(?’NAME’expression)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These named subexpressions can be referred to in a backreference using either \g{NAME} or \k<name> and can also be referred to by name in a Perl format string for search and replace operations, or in the match_results member functions.</name></p>

<h3 id="comments"><em>Comments</em></h3>

<p>(?# … ) is treated as a comment, it’s contents are ignored.</p>

<h3 id="modifiers"><em>Modifiers</em></h3>

<p>(?imsx-imsx … ) alters which of the perl modifiers are in effect within the pattern, changes take effect from the point that the block is first seen and extend to any enclosing ). Letters before a ‘-‘ turn that perl modifier on, letters afterward, turn it off.</p>

<p>(?imsx-imsx:pattern) applies the specified modifiers to pattern only.</p>

<h3 id="non-marking-groups"><em>Non-marking groups</em></h3>

<p>(?:pattern) lexically groups pattern, without generating an additional sub-expression.</p>

<h3 id="lookahead"><em>Lookahead</em></h3>

<p>(?=pattern) consumes zero characters, only if pattern matches.</p>

<p>(?!pattern) consumes zero characters, only if pattern does not match.</p>

<p>Lookahead is typically used to create the logical AND of two regular expressions, for example if a password must contain a lower case letter, an upper case letter, a punctuation symbol, and be at least 6 characters long, then the expression:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(?=.<em>[[:lower:]])(?=.</em>[[:upper:]])(?=.*[[:punct:]]).{6,}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>could be used to validate the password.</p>

<h3 id="lookbehind"><em>Lookbehind</em></h3>

<p>(?&lt;=pattern) consumes zero characters, only if pattern could be matched against the characters preceding the current position (pattern must be of fixed length).</p>

<p>(?&lt;!pattern) consumes zero characters, only if pattern could not be matched against the characters preceding the current position (pattern must be of fixed length).
Independent sub-expressions</p>

<p>(?&gt;pattern) pattern is matched independently of the surrounding patterns, the expression will never backtrack into pattern. Independent sub-expressions are typically used to improve performance; only the best possible match for pattern will be considered, if this doesn’t allow the expression as a whole to match then no match is found at all.</p>
