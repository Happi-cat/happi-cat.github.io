# SOD

You know, sharepoint has interesting thing: SOD (or Script-On-Demand)
I hope you know how it works and how to use it, in few words:

* `RegisterSod('key', '/url/script.js');` for script registration

* inside script you should call next func: `SP.SOD.notifyScriptLoadedAndExecuteWaitingJobs('scriptFileName');` for notification

But, do you know that RegisterSod normalizes keys?
Briefly speaking,  it will do next:

* if key ends with '.js' it will use 'lowercased-string.js'

* if key ends with '.*resx' it will return 'lowercased-string.resx'

* otherwise it will return key as it is.


So you can register you script like:

```
RegisterSod('Namespace.Feature', '/url/script.js');
```

Or you can use 'script.file.name.js' as a key.

But, also you should know how `notifyScriptLoadedAndExecuteWaitingJobs` function works
It accepts **script file name** and uses lowercased string.
So if you use Pascal case naming in SOD-keys and use something like this 'Namespace.Feature' you will face with notification problem:
* you've registered SOD with a normalizerd key 'Namespace.Feature' 
* tried to notify that 'namespace.feature' was loaded

### As a result

it's better to use lowercase everywhere or keys with '.js' endings:

* 'real-file-name.js'

* 'Namespace.Feature.js'
